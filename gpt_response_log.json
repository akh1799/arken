To calculate the tension, we need to know the mass of the elevator, its velocity, its height, and its acceleration. This is because the tension is related to the force required to accelerate the elevator upwards.

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nAll of the following are factors that contributed to the prominence of conservatism in the late 1970s and 1980s EXCEPT\n\n(A) the success of the Libertarian party in national elections\n(B) the growth of religious fundamentalism\n(C) perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter\n(D) social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War\n\nPlease think step by step and then solve the task.",

We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) an instrument of injustice.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent r2qe:\nI will read the passage and identify the relevant information. The passage is about the Progressive Party's platform and its ideals. It emphasizes the importance of the people's sovereignty and the need to establish equal opportunity and industrial justice. The passage also quotes Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, emphasizing the people's role in maintaining their Constitution. I will now analyze the options provided and identify the one that best exemplifies the idea presented in the passage.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent VxH3:\nThe Progressive Party Platform of 1912 emphasizes the importance of the people's role in governing and the need for equal opportunity and industrial justice. The excerpt highlights the importance of the Constitution and the need to safeguard it from those who would pervert its intent. Jacob A. Riis's book 'How the Other Half Lives' is a classic example of'muckraking' journalism, which exposes social and economic injustices. Based on this information, I will choose the answer that best exemplifies the theme of Riis's book.\n\n### thinking by Debate Agent J6NV:\nThe quote from the excerpt is about the Progressive Party's platform and its views on the Constitution, government, and the welfare of the people. The book 'How the Other Half Lives' by Jacob A. Riis is a muckraking expose about the poor living conditions of immigrants in New York City. It seems to be related to the concept of 'industrial justice' mentioned in the excerpt.

The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals.

            "thinking": "An elevator is rising. To determine the tension in the cables pulling it, we need to know the forces acting on it. The principle of motion is involved here. We can use Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, to relate the force to the mass and acceleration of the elevator. We also know that the force acting on the elevator is the tension in the cables, which is equal to the weight of the elevator plus the force due to acceleration. Therefore, we need to know the mass, acceleration, and height of the elevator to calculate the tension in the cables. The velocity is not necessary to know because it is not directly related to the tension in the cables.",

            "thinking": "Comparing the Progressive Party Platform, 1912, with Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives, I can see that Riis's book is about the lives of the poor and marginalized in New York City, highlighting their struggles and injustices. This aligns with the idea that the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, as stated in the platform. The platform also emphasizes the importance of the public welfare, which is a central theme in Riis's book. Given these connections, I believe that Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives best exemplifies the quote 'the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice.' However, this option is not provided in the multiple choice options. The closest match is (D) 'without which no republic can endure', which is a quote from the platform, but it does not directly relate to Riis's book. Therefore, I will choose the option that best fits the context of the question, which is (B)'masters of their Constitution.'

I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals.
